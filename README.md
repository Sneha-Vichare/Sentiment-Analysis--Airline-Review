**Sentiment Analysis**

Companies get multiple reviews on the service or product they offer. These reviews when analyzed for insights can help take actionable decisions for the growth of company.

Sentiment analysis is a methodology for analyzing a piece of text to discover the sentiment hidden within it. 
It accomplishes this by combining machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). 
Sentiment analysis allows you to examine the feelings expressed in a piece of text.

In this project, I have used various NLP preprocessing techniques to clean the data and utilize the LSTM layers to build the text classifier.

The dataset contains more than 14000 tweets data samples classified into 3 types: positive, negative, neutral. 

I have built a binary text classifier that classifies the sentiment of the tweets into positive and negative.
The reviews are classified as positive or negative with accuracy obtained more than 94%.
